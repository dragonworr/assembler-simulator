Base on "Samphire" [Microprocessor Simulator](http://www.softwareforeducation.com/sms32v50/index.php) instruction set (which is in turn based on x86). "Samphire" is used to teach CS1111 at University College Cork, but it is restricted to Windows.

This project aims to recreate as much of the "Samphire" application as possible using modern front-end technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Windi CSS](https://windicss.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Todo

- [ ] Seprate the processes of calculating and rendering to support faster clock speed
- [ ] More simulated I/O devices
- [ ] [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) based editor with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Progressive Web App
- [ ] File upload/download
