Based on the "Samphire" [Microprocessor Simulator](http://www.softwareforeducation.com/sms32v50/index.php) instruction set similar to the Intel 8086 chips. "Samphire" is used to teach CS1111 Systems Organisation at University College Cork, but it is restricted to Windows.

This project aims to recreate as much of the "Samphire" application as possible using modern front-end technologies:

- [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/6/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Windi CSS](https://windicss.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

You can try it online [here](https://exuanbo.xyz/assembler-simulator/).
